How To Configure:
=================
The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. To do that,
open the file "Configuration.php" and edit it's contents.

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a PHP library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a composer dependency in the generated composer.json
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

How To Use:
===========
For using this SDK do the following:
1) Open a new PHP >= 5.3 project and copy the generated PHP files in the project
   directory.
2) Use composer to install the dependencies. Usually this can be done through a 
   context menu command "Instal (dev)".
3) Include the UberAPILib.php file in your code where 
   needed using "require_once" construct.
4) You can now instantiate controllers and call the respective methods.
